# TensorflowSpecialization
A repository of all the materials and the assignments I coded/completed for the Tensorflow Specialization course(set of 4 courses) on deeplearning.ai
<h2>Course 1-Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning</h2>
<h4>This first course introduces you to TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework. You will learn how to build a basic neural network for computer vision and use convolutions to improve your neural network.</h4>
<h2>Course 2-Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow</h2>
<h4>This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.</h4>
<h2>Course 3-Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow</h2>
In this third course, you’ll learn how to apply neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow. You’ll learn how to process and represent text through tokenization so that it’s recognizable by a neural network. You’ll be introduced to new types of neural networks, including RNNs, GRUs and LSTMs, and how you can train them to understand the meaning of text. Finally, you’ll learn how to train LSTMs on existing text to create original poetry and more!
<h2>Course 4-Sequences, Time Series and Prediction</h2>
