# TensorflowSpecialization
A repository of all the materials and the assignments I coded/completed for the Tensorflow Specialization course(set of 4 courses) on deeplearning.ai
<h2>Course 1-Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning</h2>
<h4>This first course introduces you to TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework. You will learn how to build a basic neural network for computer vision and use convolutions to improve your neural network.</h4>
<h2>Course 2-Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow</h2>
<h2>Course 3-Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow</h2>
<h2>Course 4-Sequences, Time Series and Prediction</h2>
