# TensorflowSpecialization
A repository of all the materials and the assignments I coded/completed for the Tensorflow Specialization course(set of 4 courses) on deeplearning.ai
<h2>Course 1-Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning</h2>
<h4>This first course introduces you to TensorFlow, a popular machine learning framework. You will learn how to build a basic neural network for computer vision and use convolutions to improve your neural network.</h4>
<h2>Course 2-Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow</h2>
<h4>This second course teaches you advanced techniques to improve the computer vision model you built in Course 1. You will explore how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropouts. Finally, Course 2 will introduce you to transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models.</h4>
<h2>Course 3-Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow</h2>
<h2>Course 4-Sequences, Time Series and Prediction</h2>
